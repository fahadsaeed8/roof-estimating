          In 2012, a visionary architect, a seasoned building materials
          distributor, and a skilled IT expert came together with one goal in
          mind—reshape the construction industry. What began as a bold idea soon
          turned into a mission: to revolutionize roofing through innovative
          technology that simplifies challenges and promotes sustainability.
          From this vision, iRoofing was born, designed to redefine how projects
          are planned, managed, and completed. With powerful yet affordable
          tools, we empower professionals to work smarter, faster, and more
          efficiently—transforming roofing from start to finish.

    <p className="text-base md:text-lg font-semibold text-shadow-gray-800">
      We started iRoofing because we wanted to offer something both
      affordable and user-friendly – something we’d actually use
      ourselves. So, we said goodbye to crazy fees, expensive contracts,
      and all that other nonsense. It’s just better this way.

            Because every great roofing project starts with clarity. A roof
            estimate isn’t just about numbers — it’s about trust, transparency,
            and preparation. Accurate estimates help homeowners and contractors
            align on expectations, budget wisely, and avoid costly surprises.
            It’s the first step toward a smooth, professional roofing
            experience.
